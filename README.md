This project has to:

- Registers a webhook on startup
- Receives a SQL problem
- Solves the SQL query
- Submits the answer using a JWT token

## Status

 This project is **not fully working** yet. The webhook registration and data handling parts are implemented, but the full integration is incomplete due to limited time and testing scope.
